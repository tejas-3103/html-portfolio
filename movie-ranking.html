<h1>The Best movies according to Tejas</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Its one of the best movie ever made its not only about finding new home for humanity in interstellar destination but its a emotional sci fi drama </p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Too many levels of reality, too many things happening and too innovative an idea</p>
<h3>The lord of the rings</h3>
<p>This is definitely the best trilogy ever made on any medium</p>
